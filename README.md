Description:
  
  Mod gives your commander the ability to build FAKE copies of itself. Phantoms are impossible to tell apart from the REAL commander and can replicate themselves, too. BEWARE of false 'commander health critically low' in-game alarms. Fully compatible with SW, Osmech and S17. Supports MLA and Legion factions. 

Notes: 
- Legion is not compatible with Osmech. Choose wisely.
- Legion Phantoms use base game buildbar color theme, causing it to mix with legion one. Don't panic - it's a feature. :P
- Pasting Legion Phantoms in sandbox mode when Legion is not enabled will cause a crash.
